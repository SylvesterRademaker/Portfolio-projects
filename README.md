\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Portfolio Projects\
\
This repository contains a curated portfolio of projects demonstrating\
my development towards an IT / data / AI-oriented role.\
\
The portfolio is intentionally structured in layers to clearly separate\
core technical work from supporting and optional material.\
\
---\
\
## Core Portfolio\
\
These sections represent my primary technical and analytical work.\
\
### IBM Data Analysis\
End-to-end data analysis projects, including a verified IBM Data Analyst capstone,\
covering data collection, wrangling, analysis, and visualization.\
\
### ML Selected\
A curated selection of machine learning and deep learning notebooks\
focused on fundamentals and applied understanding rather than volume.\
\
### Analysis Foundation\
Foundational analytical work, including statistics and reasoning,\
supporting data and machine learning projects.\
\
---\
\
## Supporting Work\
\
These sections show how I work in applied, collaborative, and communication contexts.\
\
### Applied Research (Internal)\
Internal exploratory research conducted while contributing to the preparation\
of an AI module for a Lean Yellow Belt training.\
\
### Communication & Translation\
Material focused on translating AI concepts into clear, accessible language\
for non-technical stakeholders.\
\
---\
\
## Optional / Conceptual Work\
\
### Conceptual Work (Optional)\
Optional conceptual material demonstrating structured thinking\
and learning-path design for complex AI topics.\
\
---\
\
## Notes\
\
- Internal and conceptual materials are intentionally included in their original form.\
- The focus of this portfolio is learning progression, clarity of thinking,\
  and practical application rather than polished deliverables.}
