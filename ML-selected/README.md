This folder contains a **curated selection** of Machine Learning and Deep Learning notebooks,\
chosen specifically for **portfolio relevance** rather than volume.\
\
The goal of this section is to demonstrate **understanding, structure, and application**\
of core ML/DL concepts \'97 not to present a research or production-grade ML portfolio.\
\
---\
\
## Structure\
\
### fundamentals/\
Contains one notebook implementing a deep neural network **from scratch**.\
\
Focus:\
- Understanding forward propagation, backpropagation, gradients\
- How training mechanics work beyond framework abstraction\
- Model structure and parameter updates\
\
This notebook is included to show **conceptual depth**, not optimization or performance.\
\
---\
\
### applied-vision/\
Applied computer vision examples using modern deep learning workflows.\
\
Focus:\
- Image segmentation (U-Net)\
- Transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs\
- Practical application of DL concepts\
\
These notebooks demonstrate how core concepts are applied to real-world problems.\
\
---\
\
### sequence-models/\
Sequence-based deep learning example.\
\
Focus:\
- Temporal / sequential data\
- Understanding sequence modeling concepts\
- Practical application of RNN-based architectures\
\
---\
\
## Positioning Note\
\
These notebooks are:\
- Part of structured coursework (IBM / DeepLearning.AI)\
- Selected and reorganized for portfolio clarity\
- Intended to demonstrate **learning capability and technical understanding**\
\
They are **not** presented as production systems or research work.\
\
---\
\
## Summary\
\
This section supports a broader profile focused on:\
- Data analysis and IT fundamentals\
- Strong analytical reasoning\
- A clear growth path toward AI / Data roles\
\
Only a limited number of ML/DL labs are included intentionally to maintain focus and clarity.}
